project euler solutions in Rust. 

project euler is a website offering maths problems roughly in order of increasing difficulty
https://projecteuler.net/archives

I go through the problems one-by-one, so there's a 'complete' subfolder for completeness. 
but also a 'highlights' subfolder with solutions i like most or found most instructive. 

this is for the purposes of a portfolio in support of university applications, so i will
include short readmes for some solutions to demonstrate my reasoning and anything i may have
learned.
