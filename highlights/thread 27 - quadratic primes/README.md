brute force was the first thing i reached for for this one, 
but i saw a blog on raw.org ( https://raw.org/puzzle/project-euler/problem-27/ )
explaining how B has to be prime, and they manually put in an array of primes.

my solution is more complicated than it needs to be, to be sure, but i had
been practising iterators and saw the opportunity to make one here.
